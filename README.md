Almost everyone loves to listen to music. Imagine, creating a music player of your own that involves scanning through project files to find music files, browsing through various tracks, adding music from your favourite artists, or controlling the volume. 

With this Python project, you create a simple music player with an interactive UI to play around with.

To be able to build this project you should have Tkinter and pygame installed on your device.

* I used Tkinter to render my applicationâ€™s menu and its buttons, as well as to load the music from files, and then to play, pause, and stop it using pygame library. Also, Tkinter is a lightweight module and can be used to create cross-platform applications (the same code will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux).

* In Python, Pygame provides an inbuilt method called mixer () which allows us to deal with sound files easily.
